How to attribute?
Creating content takes a lot of time and effort, which is why we ask you to provide a link to attribute the source. Where will you be using the image?

 
For example: websites, social media, blogs, ebooks, newsletters, etc.

Copy this link and paste it in a visible place, close to where you’re using the image. If that’s not possible, place it at the footer of your website, blog or newsletter, or in the credits section.

For example: "image: Freepik.com". This cover has been designed using assets from Freepik.com

 
Online video platforms (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.)
